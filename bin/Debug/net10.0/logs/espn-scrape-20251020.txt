href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a></a> have bounced back from losses better than any <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">NFL</a> team for nearly three years.\n\n\r\n              Detroit has not dropped consecutive games in the regular season since coach Dan Campbell's second season got off to a shaky start, falling to 1-6 on Oct. 30, 2022.\n\n\r\n              The Lions' 50-game stretch without back-to-back setbacks is the longest in the league since Green Bay went 53 games without consecutive losses from late in the 2018 season through the 2022 season, according to Sportradar, and the next-longest active run is 18 games by the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a>.\n\n\r\n              “They’re a resilient group,” Campbell said. “They know how to overcome adversity. They don’t like losing and they go back to work to fix the things that need to be fixed.”\n\n\r\n              If Detroit (4-2) does not address problems it had on both sides of the ball in last week's loss to Kansas City, its remarkable run may end against the NFC-leading <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/tampa-bay-buccaneers\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></a> (5-1) on Monday night at home.\n\n\r\n              “We’ve got our hands full,” Campbell said.\n\n\r\n              After the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history with four wins by three or fewer points in the first five games of season, they <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/49ers-buccaneers-score-4ff79691b71f6d6e563c043b127521d7\">beat San Francisco</a> 30-19 last week.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Short-handed</hl2>\r\n              Detroit's banged-up secondary took another hit when the NFL <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lions-chiefs-brian-branch-suspension-8c3121758abd604015dc220a9a884d17\">suspended safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692025/brian-branch\">Brian Branch</a></a> for punching Chiefs receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> on Sunday night and setting off a postgame melee.\n\n\r\n              The Lions have five players in their secondary on injured reserve and they held defensive backs <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360383/kerby-joseph\">Kerby Joseph</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4592837/terrion-arnold\">Terrion Arnold</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123938/avonte-maddox\">Avonte Maddox</a> out of practice with injuries on Thursday.\n\n\r\n              Tampa Bay is expecting to be without three of its top receivers, but the position group may get a boost with the return of six-time Pro Bowl receiver <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tampa-bay-buccaneers-mike-evans-919d12693b619f51ec0b2aff21f6fe04\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a></a>. He was limited in practice on Thursday after missing three games with a hamstring injury.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>They're No. 1 </hl2>\r\n              Both quarterbacks, Detroit's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> and Tampa Bay's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a>, were drafted No. 1 overall by another team that traded them.\n\n\r\n              \"Can recognize that there’s some dark days in that transition and coming out the other side of it for both of us,” Goff said.\n\n\r\n              The Los Angeles Rams kicked off the 2016 draft by taking Goff and after five seasons, including one that ended at the Super Bowl, they dealt him in a blockbuster deal for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>.\n\n\r\n              Cleveland selected Mayfield first overall in 2018 and traded him four years later to Carolina. The Panthers released him later that year and he finished the 2022 season with the Rams. The Bucs gave him another chance by signing him in 2023 and he has made the most of the opportunity, reviving his career.\n\n\r\n              “Both of them have overcome a lot,” Campbell said.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Rachaad’s role</hl2>\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4697815/rachaad-white\">Rachaad White</a> went from being Tampa Bay's primary back to splitting time with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4596448/bucky-irving\">Bucky Irving</a> last season. With Irving out the past two games, White has 157 scrimmage yards and three rushing touchdowns.\n\n\r\n              “Rachaad made some really, really good plays,” Mayfield said.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Return of the mack</hl2>\r\n              <hl2 />\r\n              Detroit defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361662/alim-mcneill\">Alim McNeill</a>, who signed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/detroit-lions-alim-mcneill-contract-5e21c36d5c00011202989b9e4fce5c90\">$97 million contract extension</a> a year ago, is expected to play for the first time since tearing the ACL in his right knee late last season.\n\n\r\n              “It's going to be a big day, a big deal, in the back of my head,” he said.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Sack attack</hl2>\r\n              The Buccaneers had 10 sacks in the first five games before registering six against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241464/mac-jones\">Mac Jones</a> in a win over the 49ers last week. They recorded a sack on 15.4% of dropbacks. Even more impressive, Tampa Bay didn’t have to blitz much to get pressure.\n\n\r\n              “It all starts up front for us,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. “If we can get off the ball and you don’t have to blitz and you can go with four (rushers) and they work together, we’re a pretty good defense.”\n\n\r\n              Linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4686334/yaya-diaby\">Yaya Diaby</a> had two sacks on Jones and leads the team with three.

to win consistently at home. \n\n\r\n              Seattle is 3-0 on the road this season but 1-2 at Lumen Field, a loud stadium that not so long ago was one of the team’s prized advantages. \n\n\r\n              The Seahawks host the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Houston Texans</a> (2-3) on Monday night, hoping to get some of that Lumen Field mojo going. \n\n\r\n              The home slump became apparent last season, when the Seahawks went 3-6 at Lumen, their worst record in Seattle since 2008. \n\n\r\n              “We have to win at home, We have to defend our home turf. We know that,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said after the Seahawks fell 38-35 to Tampa Bay in Seattle two weeks ago. \n\n\r\n              \"It’s really important that we play better at home. It’s been an important emphasis since I was hired. Hasn’t come to life yet. We’re determined to make it come to life.”\n\n\r\n              Fortunately for the Seahawks, they're winning on the road. Seattle was coming off a 20-12 win at Jacksonville, which extended the team's franchise record to nine straight road wins. \n\n\r\n              Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold</a> threw for 295 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the victory. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430878/jaxon-smith-njigba\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a> finished with eight catches for 162 yards and a 61-yard TD reception in the second quarter.\n\n\r\n              Houston had a bye week following a 44-10 road win over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> before the break. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> was the AFC Offensive Player of the Week after throwing for 244 yards and a season-high four touchdowns in the victory. \n\n\r\n              The Texans lost their first three games of the season, but have rebounded with a pair of wins. \n\n\r\n              “It’s still early in the season,\" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. \"A lot of teams had a lot of really good starts to the season. But we all know, and it’s our focus, it’s all about how you finish the season. It’s all about how your team grows throughout the season. Just because you have a great start doesn’t mean it’s going to be a great finish. You just continue to work, control what you can control and you truly focus on one game at a time. That’s all that matters.” \n\n\r\n              <hl2>Doing it all</hl2>\r\n              Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241223/jalen-pitre\">Jalen Pitre</a> is off to a great start this season and leads the Texans with three interceptions after he had two in Houston’s game against the Ravens. The fourth-year player does a little bit of everything for the Texans and Ryans said he’s one of the reasons their defense has been successful this season.\n\n\r\n              “Whether that’s blitzing, whether it’s playing in coverage, whether it’s playing back deep — all three levels of the defense, Jalen provides us that flexibility to be able to move him around wherever we need to put him each week,” Ryans said. “So, to have a player who is as smart as he is and as reliable as he is, it really gives you a comfort as a play-caller.”\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Closing it out</hl2>\r\n              Seattle held Jacksonville to 273 yards, including just 59 yards rushing. The defense had seven sacks and forced three straight fourth-quarter punts. \n\n\r\n              Macdonald said it was important for the D to prove it could close out games.\n\n\r\n              “It’s been an emphasis for us,” Macdonald said. “We weren’t shying away from it. Our guys were awesome. I think you could sense it on the sideline that they wanted the opportunity to go out there and go play, and that’s all you can ask for as a coach.\"\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Chubb and Marks</hl2>\r\n              The Texans have used both <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb\">Nick Chubb</a> and rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429059/woody-marks\">Woody Marks</a> at running back this season with star <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116385/joe-mixon\">Joe Mixon</a> out indefinitely with a foot injury. Chubb leads the team with 249 yards rushing and two touchdowns and Marks has 137 yards rushing and a TD run. Marks has also been a playmaker out of the backfield and has 96 yards receiving with another score.\n\n\r\n              The Texans have also been impressed with the blocking of Marks, a fourth-round pick from USC.\n\n\r\n              “He’s put it on tape that he’s a violent protector and can get underneath people and knows where to go,” offensive coordinator Nick Caley said. “So, I’ve been very pleased with his development. It’s been steady since he’s been here, and we’ll just continue to keep it on that trajectory.”\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed

Steelers","Cincinnati Bengals","Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cincinnati Bengals","NFL"],"story":"CINCINNATI -- — Mike Tomlin wondered this week why the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a> traded <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco</a> to their AFC North rival, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>.\n\n\r\n              On Thursday night, Flacco proved Tomlin's worst fears to be well founded.\n\n\r\n              Flacco passed for 342 yards and three touchdowns as he rallied Cincinnati to a 33-31 victory. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360234/evan-mcpherson\">Evan McPherson</a> had four field goals, the last a 36-yarder with seven seconds remaining to put the Bengals on top and snap a four-game losing streak.\n\n\r\n              The 40-year-old Flacco completed 31 of 47 passes in his second Cincinnati start after being acquired Oct. 7, and outdueled 41-year-old <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> in only the third regular-season game between starting quarterbacks in their 40s.\n\n\r\n              Bengals fans were chanting “Thank you Cleveland! Thank you Cleveland!” when Flacco appeared on Prime Video's postgame set on the field, which brought a smile to coach Zac Taylor's face.\n\n\r\n              “Our fans are happy, and I’m happy,\" Taylor said. “It’s a big victory. We needed this. It had been a long time since we won.\"\n\n\r\n              Cincinnati led most of the second half, but Rodgers gave Pittsburgh a 31-30 advantage with 2:31 remaining on a 68-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361411/pat-freiermuth\">Pat Freiermuth</a>. \n\n\r\n              On second-and-20, Rodgers rolled left and found Freiermuth open downfield. The fifth-year tight end caught the ball at the Bengals 36 after getting separation from safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240575/geno-stone\">Geno Stone</a> and scored his second touchdown.\n\n\r\n              “I told him to be ready. I saw something on the pictures on the sideline in the first half. So at halftime I pulled him aside. I had a nice shot down the middle,” said Rodgers, who went 22 of 32 for 244 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions. \n\n\r\n              That set the stage for the 23rd fourth-quarter comeback of Flacco’s 18-year career. \n\n\r\n              Flacco led the Bengals (3-4) 52 yards in eight plays, including completions of 15 and 18 yards to Ja’Marr Chase got Cincinnati into Pittsburgh territory. Flacco then found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins\">Tee Higgins</a> for a 28-yard gain to the Steelers 5 with 1:39 remaining to put the Bengals well within McPherson’s range.\n\n\r\n              “It’s very fun. It’s because of games like this that we do what we do,\" Flacco said.\n\n\r\n              Chase had a franchise-record 16 receptions for 161 yards and a TD, making him the fourth receiver in NFL history with two games of at least 14 catches in a single season. Higgins finished with six catches for 96 yards and a score. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant\">Noah Fant</a> also had a TD reception.\n\n\r\n              The Bengals scored on seven of their last eight possessions and won for the first time since <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> went down with a toe injury Sept. 14. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886812/jake-browning\">Jake Browning</a> struggled in his three starts after Burrow's injury, prompting the Bengals to acquire Flacco.\n\n\r\n              “Last week, it seemed we had finally figured out how it was going to be with Flacco and the offensive line. And today we showed what we’re capable of,\" Chase said.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362238/chase-brown\">Chase Brown</a> had 108 rushing yards on 11 carries, the second 100-yard game of his career.\n\n\r\n              Freiermuth had four catches for 106 yards for the Steelers (4-2). <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569987/jaylen-warren\">Jaylen Warren</a> ran for 127 yards on 16 carries.\n\n\r\n              “I just thought the first half we allowed them to run the ball too much,\" Tomlin said. “Then we turned the ball over a couple of times, and that just kind of set a negative trajectory. We’re fighting uphill the rest of the way.”\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Bengals rally in second quarter</hl2>\r\n              Pittsburgh jumped out to a 10-0 lead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17372/chris-boswell\">Chris Boswell</a>'s 41-yard field goal early in the second quarter before Rodgers' passes was picked off on consecutive drives.\n\n\r\n              Cincinnati scored a touchdown in the first half for the first time in five games with 4:42 remaining in the first half when Flacco found Chase in the left corner of the end zone for an 8-yard score.\n\n\r\n              The Bengals then converted both of Rodgers’ interceptions into points. On the first play of the next drive, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567098/jordan-battle\">Jordan Battle</a> picked off a deep ball intended for Metcalf at the Bengals 24. Three plays later, Flacco’s 29-yard quick slant to Higgins gave Cincinnati its first lead since the first quarter of the Week 4 Monday night game at Denver.\n\n\r\n              After <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036211/dj-turner\">DJ Turner</a> picked off Flacco’s pass along the left sideline at the Cincinnati 30 with 40 seconds remaining, McPherson booted a 49-yarder to make it 17-10 at halftime.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>All day and night</hl2>\r\n              The Steelers scored a touchdown on an opening drive for the third time this season when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054212/jonnu-smith\">Jonnu Smith</a> caught a 10-yard pass from Rodgers with 10:51 remaining in the first quarter.\n\n\r\n              Rodgers held onto the ball for 8.598 seconds before connecting with Smith in the end zone. It was Rodgers’ longest time to throw on a completion since the NFL’s Next Gen Stats started tracking in 2016.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Injuries</hl2>\r\n              Bengals: DE <a

href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> on Sunday. \n\n\r\n              That's a first for an NFL international game.\n\n\r\n              “Do I get a sword or something?” a smiling Stafford asked.\n\n\r\n              No, but Stafford and the Rams do get to fly home with a 5-2 record — their best start since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2021.\n\n\r\n              The most recent time he threw five touchdowns in a game was on Thanksgiving in 2015 in Detroit's 45-14 win over the Eagles.\n\n\r\n              On Sunday, he had little trouble with Jacksonville's defense by connecting with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a> for three scores at the iconic home of English soccer.\n\n\r\n              Stafford, who has thrown 12 touchdowns with no interceptions in his past four games, also connected with rookie receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4710855/konata-mumpfield\">Konata Mumpfield</a> and rookie tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4570037/terrance-ferguson\">Terrance Ferguson</a> in the London rout.\n\n\r\n              Stafford and Adams found the right time to connect because <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426515/puka-nacua\">Puka Nacua</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rams-puka-nacua-out-jaguars-becca36ee7079aad99153d426b2293ee\">missed the game</a> with an ankle injury.\n\n\r\n              “We saw a few opportune moments to go and take advantage of some 1-on-1s,” said Adams, who noted that he and Stafford had been exchanging extra text messages in recent weeks and “talking through certain things.\"\n\n\r\n              Adams became the second player to score three touchdowns in an international game. The NFL said the first was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9614/marcedes-lewis\">Marcedes Lewis</a>, who had three in Jacksonville's 44-7 win over the Ravens at Wembley in 2017.\n\n\r\n              Adams, who caught two touchdown passes in the first half, then added a third on a 1-yard jump ball that sent Jags fans to the exits.\n\n\r\n              Stafford completed 21 of 33 passes for 182 yards. Jags quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a> finished 23 of 48 for 296 yards and the touchdown pass to Hunter.\n\n\r\n              In 2014, Stafford engineered Detroit’s 22-21 comeback win over the Falcons after trailing 21-0 at halftime.\n\n\r\n              “It’s a blast. Sometimes travel is tough, but once you get out here, the fans are great, people are great,” the 37-year-old quarterback said.\n\n\r\n              The Jaguars allowed seven sacks and committed 13 penalties for 119 yards.\n\n\r\n              “I’m not going to stand up here and blame these players, it starts with me,” Jags coach Liam Coen said. “You wouldn’t have guessed that we were here for a week, prepared, ready to go play in this atmosphere by looking at it in terms of the way we started the game.”\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Hunter gets first TD</hl2>\r\n              The only highlight for the Jaguars (4-3) was rookie two-way star <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685415/travis-hunter\">Travis Hunter</a> getting <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/travis-hunter-jaguars-touchdown-d11b665125c50389a75221669336a856\">his first NFL touchdown</a>. It made the score 28-7 in the fourth quarter.\n\n\r\n              Hunter had his best day as a pro, catching eight passes for 101 yards and the score.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Siu party at Wembley</hl2>\r\n              Despite <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jaguars-rams-london-0230d07103033d0b079c21ab27563f35\">arriving in London on Saturday morning</a>, the Rams looked plenty fresh by scoring three first-half touchdowns.\n\n\r\n              Mumpfield scored the first and Adams the next two. Both hit the “Siu” celebration made famous by Portugal soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"https://x.com/RamsNFL/status/1979908200024404262\">Mumpfield's celebration</a> came after the rookie receiver scored his first NFL touchdown — on just his second career catch — a 5-yard reception at the back of the end zone to cap a 13-play, 60-yard opening drive.\n\n\r\n              Five different players caught passes on the Rams’ opening drive.\n\n\r\n              We spread the ball around a bunch today,” Stafford said.\n\n\r\n              On the second drive, Stafford hit Adams on a quick fade for a 2-yard touchdown pass and a 14-0 lead before the end of the first quarter. The star receiver then gave <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLUKIRE/status/1979913005568500137\">his version of the siu</a>.\n\n\r\n              Jags CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045207/jourdan-lewis\">Jourdan Lewis</a> was in coverage on both TDs.\n\n\r\n              Adams then caught a 1-yard touchdown pass before the end of the half to make it 21-0. No siu that time, though.\n\n\r\n              But Adams got <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLUKIRE/status/1979950533629854062\">most of the offense to do one</a> after his third touchdown.\n\n\r\n              Ferguson’s 31-yard touchdown reception on fourth-and-1 made the score 28-0 early in the fourth.\n\n\r\n              Rams linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567123/byron-young\">Byron Young</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/TheLARamsPR/status/1979913827417288958\">extended his sack streak</a> to nine regular-season games.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key injuries</hl2>\r\n              Rams: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rams-puka-nacua-out-jaguars-becca36ee7079aad99153d426b2293ee\">Nacua (ankle) had been ruled out</a> earlier this week.
